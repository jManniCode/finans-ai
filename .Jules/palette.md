## 2026-02-03 - Destructive Action Confirmation
**Learning:** Immediate execution of destructive actions (like deleting a session) creates anxiety and potential data loss for users.
**Action:** Always wrap delete buttons in a confirmation dialog or popover to provide a safety net ("friction").

## 2026-02-04 - Blank Canvas Paralysis
**Learning:** Empty chat interfaces can intimidate users who aren't sure what the AI is capable of ("What should I ask?").
**Action:** Implement "Quick Start" suggestion buttons (chips) that offer one-click access to high-value, common queries. This guides the user and demonstrates capabilities immediately.

## 2026-02-05 - The "Welcome Mat" Effect
**Learning:** "Quick Start" buttons are helpful tools, but they lack personality. Users feel more comfortable when the system explicitly greets them and confirms it has finished processing their data.
**Action:** Add a friendly, explanatory "empty state" message that sits in the chat area before the first message, acting as a bridge between the upload phase and the conversation phase.
